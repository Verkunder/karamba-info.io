## Openvidu load test results.
 
 Still reading this blog? 
 Naturally this is the part you are most interested in as an OpenVidu user, but all that has been explained up to this point is of the utmost importance in order to fully understand the nature of the following results. 
 Here we go:

Preliminary OpenVidu performance according to server resources, for sessions 7:7 (sessions with 7 users in which all transmit to all). 
Table states the maximum number of entities that can be properly handled by a single server until no more sessions can be launched

First of all, RAM is never a problem (as expected. WebRTC is basically a CPU-intensive process). 
Network performance isnâ€™t a problem either, thanks to the generous bandwitdh provided by AWS (in the test with the larger machine, a total of 250 GB of data was received/transmitted by OpenVidu Server Instance in just 27 minutes). 
So the resource that finally triggers the termination of the test is always the CPU, when it reaches a 100% usage and no more petitions can be handled.

With this in mind, we can see that a very small server such as a c5.large instance can still handle 28 users at the same time, and a total of 196 WebRTC audio-video streams. 
This number grows while increasing the size of the server, not exactly in a linear way. 
This demonstrates that bigger machines, althoug they can of course handle many more streams, do not provide a fully proportional improvement.

This must be taken into account depending on the nature of the applications implemented with Openvidu: if one session is going to host more than 100 users, then a big machine is mandatory. 
But if sessions are expected to be less crowded and it is possible to use smaller machines, overall efficiency will be a little bit higher. 
This result also means that implementing an autoscaling system that can take advantage of multiple smaller machines will have an even higher priority in Openvidu roadmap.
