##  The spark that ignited OpenVidu load testing.

 Some months ago CoSMo Software published a very interesting study comparing the performance of different WebRTC Open Source SFUs solutions (here you have the paper and some slides presenting it).

OpenVidu was included… and it didn’t perform great. In fact, it performed really bad in compare with other alternatives. 
These are the reasons we thought might have led to this kind of result at that moment, and which we could confirm and fix later:

###  Issue with file descriptors management in OpenVidu Server.

CoSMo Software had some problems running OpenVidu in large instances (≥ 16 cores), and they impacted the final performance in their experiment. 
We discovered later that there was a bug related to the number of file descriptors that could be opened by OpenVidu at the same time in machines with this number of cores. 
Bug that is now resolved.
### Fixed upper limit for connection’s bandwidth.

CoSMo Software’s experiment took as one of their quality metrics the bitrate sent and received by the clients during the load test.
And OpenVidu was limitting the maximum bandwidth both sent and receive by clients by default to 600 Kbps (on that we agreed it was too restrictive). 
So now that limit is set to 1 MBps by default, and in our tests there would be no limit at all.

### Some libnice bugs

libnice is an open source library implementing ICE protocol, a crucial part of any WebRTC communication process. 
And OpenVidu includes it for that purpose. libnice has recently been updated with some important patches that brings a remarkable performance boost. 
This is further explained in Kurento 6.9.0 release notes.

Besides these points, CoSMo Software ran the experiment using a Docker deployment of OpenVidu, which is not currently officially supported and in the end is another layer of complexity to take into account when performing this kind of tests. 
We will use a native Ubuntu deployment of OpenVidu (exactly the same as stated in OpenVidu Documentation).
