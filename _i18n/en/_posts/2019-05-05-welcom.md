## Openvidu load testing.



Openvidu has evolved a lot since its inception nearly two years ago. 

The team has been really focused on building the core features for our real-time WebRTC based multimedia platform, putting a lot of effort into providing a developer-friendly environment.

We have invested time in supporting as many languages and frameworks as possible, as well as building many guided tutorials to make the first contact with OpenVidu as smooth as possible.

We are really proud of the results so far, and the growth and usage of Openvidu, higher every day, proves that the effort has been worthwhile.
 
That said, next logical step in our roadmap is working towards a more robust, trustworthy setup for production environments. 
Openvidu is right now a great platform for many use cases, but it lacks an undoubtedly important feature: automated scalability. 
This may push back developers who want to implement self-sustaining and self-scalable massive videoconference systems. 
 
So, first step at this exciting moment for us is to answer the following question:
 
-  How many media connections can an Openvidu instance handle right now?
   
This may seem like an obvious question that we should have been clear about a long time ago, but it is not an easy task to do so (and to do it well). 
Of course we have tested many times pretty big video sessions involving many users, but we donâ€™t have enough people and devices to really push Openvidu to its limits. 
And naturally performing such test manually is neither practical, nor fast nor elegant.

So, the following statement became an absolute priority:

-  We must have an automated load test system that allows us to run massive video conference scenarios, replicate them and analyse their behavior
