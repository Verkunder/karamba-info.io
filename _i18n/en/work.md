How does Openvidu Karamba?
---
WebRTC is the ultimate responsible for all media transmission at the very heart of Karamba. WebRTC is a modern, cross-platform framework that democratizes media transmission over the Internet. It is promoted by Google, Mozilla, Opera and others.
Karamba wraps and hides all the low-level operations. The main goal we pursue is to provide a simple, effective, easy-to-use API so you can forget about WebRTC, ICE candidates and media server tricky stuff. Just include the Karamba client-side and Karamba Server for handling the media flows. To securize your video-calls from your backend, you can make use of one of the available backend-clients or simply consume the REST API exposed by Karamba Server.
